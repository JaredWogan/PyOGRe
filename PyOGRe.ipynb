    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PyOGRe is the Python port of the Mathematica package OGRe, written by Professor Barak Shoshany at Brock University. OGRe is a tensor calculus package that is designed to be both powerful and user-friendly. OGRe can perform calculations involving tensors extremely quickly, which could often take hours to do by hand. It is extremely easy to pick up and use, with easy to learn syntax. Naturally, the package has applications in general relativity and differential geometry where tensors are used abundantly and was the focus point during the development of the package. However, there is no restriction preventing the package from being used for other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tensors are abstract mathematical objects that can be represented by multidimensional arrays. A tensor may be represented by anything from a scalar, a vector, a matrix, to a $N$-dimensional array. Each array is a specific representation of a tensor, but this representation is not the only valid representation. By performing a change of coordinates, or changing the index configuration, we can produce another completely valid representation of the same tensor. It is thus crucial that we specify both a set of coordinates and an index configuration when calling a specific array a representation of a tensor. Take, for example, the (rank 2) tensor $T_{\\mu \\nu}$ below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_{\\mu \\nu}(t, x, y, z) =\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "T_{tt} & T_{tx} & T_{ty} & T_{tz} \\\\\n",
    "T_{xt} & T_{xx} & T_{xy} & T_{xz} \\\\\n",
    "T_{yt} & T_{yx} & T_{yy} & T_{yz} \\\\\n",
    "T_{zt} & T_{zx} & T_{zy} & T_{zz}\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix} =\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "T_{00} & T_{01} & T_{02} & T_{03} \\\\\n",
    "T_{10} & T_{11} & T_{12} & T_{13} \\\\\n",
    "T_{20} & T_{21} & T_{22} & T_{23} \\\\\n",
    "T_{30} & T_{31} & T_{32} & T_{33}\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is a single representation of the tensor $T$, with two lower indices, written in standard Cartesian coordinates. We call $T$ a rank two tensor because it requires two indices to specify a component of the tensor; this means a scalar can represent a rank zero tensor, a vector can represent a rank one tensor, and so on (note how we do not say a scalar is a tensor, but instead that it can represent a tensor). If we wrote the same tensor in a different coordinate system, or with a different index configuration, the components would be completely different. Since we are working with representations of abstract objects, it is clear that we must be careful and ensure that all representations of a given tensor truly do represent the same tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When working with tensors, it is natural to want to combine them in different ways. PyOGRe allows the user to perform calculations involving tensors in a straightforward manner. The user will only need to input a tensor once with a specified choice of coordinates and an index configuration, then behind the scenes, PyOGRe will automatically ensure the correct representation of the tensor is used. This makes the often complicated and/or confusing expressions involving tensors straightforward, taking away the unnecessary complexities of the calculation. Some of the possible operations that PyOGRe can perform are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addition\n",
    "- Subtraction\n",
    "- Multiplication by a scalar\n",
    "- Trace\n",
    "- Contraction\n",
    "- Partial and Covariant Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation provided below will ensure that a proper theoretical understanding of the mathematics behind the operations is achieved, then, we will explain how each calculation can be performed using PyOGRe.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the scenes, PyOGRe takes an object-oriented design and stores each tensor as a single object (we will explain object-oriented design in a later section). Each object stores all the representations of the tensor, where each representation is stored as an array. We ensure that all representations stored within the tensor object truly represents the same tensor by preventing the user from modifying the data once it has been created. Preventing the user from changing the data of a tensor is a fundamental part of the object-oriented design, as it allows a series of assumptions to be made about the tensor, greatly improving performance and preventing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of allowing the user to modify the data of a tensor, PyOGRe instead allows the user to request specific reprentations of any tensor. Handling the data of a tensor in this manner allows PyOGRe to be much more efficient; if a specific representation already exists, it will not be recalculated, while still giving the user the ability to request a tensor in different representations. Secondly, if a represntation of a tensor is calculated in some intermediate step of a calculation, all intermediate representations are stored as well, which can provide another increase in efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remainder of this document will outline why we have decided to port OGRe to Python, a brief list of the features, the meaning of object-oriented design, the differences between the original OGRe package and PyOGRe, and finally documentation of each module of the package."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Porting** a piece of software is simply the act of converting a piece of software from one programming language to another. A port is meant to achieve the same level of functionality. PyOGRe is simply a port of the OGRe package written in Mathematica to Python. Both versions of the package will retain near identical syntax, as well as cross compatibility, so that work in one package may be freely moved to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to port the package from Mathematica to Python consists of several motivating factors. One of the primary reasons is because Mathematica requires a license which must be purchased. This makes accessing the package difficult for people who may not have the required funding for a Mathematica license, which is where Python can help. Python is **freely** available for anyone to install, so by porting the package to Python, we are removing the paywall that the Mathematica version currently imposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, while Mathematica is extremely powerful and popular within the mathematics or physics communities, Python is far more popular in general. Python has been seeing a surge in popularity over the past years and is now becoming one of the most common languages beginners start with, especially within physics. Porting the package to Python will thus vastly improve the number of potential users, as well as the **accessibility** over the existing package in Mathematica.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in order to port the package to another language, we needed to consider which languages had support for **symbolic computation**. Again, Python is a clear option over a language such as C/C++, as it is both popular for scientific computation already, and has support for symbolic computation through a package called SymPy. We have used SymPy extensively when developing PyOGRe and have found it to be both easy to use and powerful. SymPy is very easy to pick up and learn, and there is very little the end user will have to know about SymPy in order to use PyOGRe. Of course, since Python is also an object-oriented language, we were able to stay true to the object-oriented design philosophy, which was not entirely possible with Mathematica.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PyOGRe is not meant to be a replacement for OGRe in any way, but merely a complimentary package to the existing package, giving the user flexibility to perform computation in either Python or Mathematica. All of the same features found in the original package are available in PyOGRe or will be made available in the future. We have also made it possible for the user to export and import tensors created in one version of the package to the other version."

    "- Built-in tensors for commonly used coordinate systems and metrics.\n",
    "- Built-in functions for calculating the Christoffel symbols (the Levi-Cevita connection), Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, Einstein Tensor, curve Lagrangian, and volume element from a metric, as well as the norm squared of any tensor.\n",
    "- Calculate the geodesic equations in terms of a user defined curve parameter (affine parameter), using either the Christoffel symbols or the curve Lagrangian (for spacetime metrics, the geodesic equations can be calculated in terms of the time coordinate).\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Object-oriented programming** (OOP) simply refers to a programming paradigm in which objects are used to combine data and functionality. Each object contains some amount of data (often called **attributes**), as well as functions that can operate on that data (often called **methods**). Each **object** belongs to a **class** that the user defines and can be thought of as a blueprint. The class tells the end user what kind of data each object will have, and how that data should be stored. The class also tells the end user what kind of functions each object will have, and how those functions should be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extremely important aspect of object-oriented design is the idea of **encapsulation**. Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object, and only exposing the interface to the user. What this means is that the user may only access the data of an object through methods defined by the class but is unable to change or modify the actual data of the object directly. This enables a new idea, **class invariants**, which are assumptions about the object that should always be preserved. The invariance of a class allows the assumption that all data stored in each object remains valid, leading to more efficient and simpler code.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we discussed previously, tensors are abstract mathematical objects, which makes object-oriented programming a natural choice. Each tensor is stored as a single, self-contained object. The tensor object stores all the required data about each tensor, including the components for each known or calculated representation. Since all tensors in PyOGRe share a common class, we only need to define operations on tensor objects once in an abstract manner, and PyOGRe will automatically be able to apply these operations to any tensor object.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important class invariant of a tensor object in PyOGRe are naturally the components of the tensor in each representation. Since each tensor stores these components in the object representing the tensor, it is crucial that each representation does indeed represent the tensor. This is done through encapsulation; the user is **not** allowed to access these components of the tensor once it has been defined. The components may only be modified by **private methods** (methods the user does not have access to) that preserve the invariance of the class. This prevents the user from accidentally violating the class invariance, and thus, the invariance of the tensor object. This again, allows us to work under the assumption that all the data stored inside a tensor object is valid, and that the data does in fact represent the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In PyOGRe, the user will initially define (or **construct**) a tensor in some specific representation once but will then never have to worry about coordinates or indices anymore. In fact, the user will not even need to remember which coordinates or indices were used to construct the tensor in the first place. The user will simply be able to request the tensor in any representation they desire, or when performing calculations, PyOGRe will determine which representation is required in each context.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important distinguishing feature between the Mathematica version (OGRe) and the Python version (PyOGRe) of the package is that in Python, we can truly define tensors as objects. In Mathematica, there is no notion of a class; all tensors are simply represented as an association. At heart, the Mathematica version operates as though it is object-oriented, and ensures that the \"objects\" are invariant, however the objects themselves are merely a list. This is because Mathematica is not an object-oriented programming language; in Mathematica, it is not possible to define class methods, as there are no classes to begin with. To ensure PyOGRe feels familiar to the user, we have also included functions alongside the class methods that maintain the same functionality."

    "The difference is that in Python, defining a metric can be done by calling a method on a coordinate system. PyOGRe will then know automatically that the new metric is defined in terms of the Cartesian coordinates and will not have to be told explicitly. Of course, one can also create a new tensor by calling a method on the metric. If instead the user wanted to calculate the norm squared of a tensor, the user could use the method ```calc_norm_squared``` on the tensor in PyOGRe, where in OGRe one would instead have to write ```TCalcNormSquared```, with the tensor as an argument. It should be noted though that the functional equivalents of these methods are also available in PyOGRe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another minute difference between the two versions, is that in OGRe, function names use camel case (e.g., TCalcNormSquared). In PyOGRe, we use snake case to adhere to common Python conventions (e.g., calc_norm_squared). This does not in any way change the functionality of the functions or methods, it is merely a slightly different naming scheme."

    "The next operation one can perform with tensors is tensor **contraction**, which can be thought of as a generalization of the vector inner product. Contraction is performed by summing over a pair of indices, where each index appears once as a lower index and once as an upper index. An example of contraction that we have already seen is the contraction of a tensor with the metric, which raises or lowers an index. Similarly, the contraction of a tensor with a Jacobian or inverse Jacobian is a coordinate transformation.\n",

Contractions involving higher rank tensors can then be seen as an extension of the inner product. For example:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is also perfectly valid to perform contractions on pairs of indices from more than two tensors at the same time, however such contractions may be broken down into individual operations. As an example, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M^{a}{}^{b}{} N_{b}{}_{c}{} L^{c}{}^{d}{} = g_{b}{}_{i}{} g_{c}{}_{j}{} M^{a}{}^{b}{} N^{i}{}^{j}{} L^{c}{}^{d}{}.\n",

    "It is important to note that in a contraction, there are two different types of indices: the **contracted indices** which are summed over, and **free indices** which are not summed over. The result of performing a tensor contraction will be given by the number of free indices, so in the example above, the resulting tensor would have rank $2$ as $a$ and $d$ are both free indices, while $b$ and $c$ are contracted indices."
